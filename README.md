**Developer Notes**
For this project I was tasked with developing a 3 page personal web app using the Bootstrap Framework.  Starting out I decided to copy a lot out of bootstrap but quickly realized that I had to cut out a lot of the extra code as it did nothing to the overall application pages.

After talking with some classmates I found that most of them found the sample images hard to follow so I decided to format it myself and really try to create a personalized web portfolio.  Below are some images of my finished product.
